The MARIA Lab is a place where faculty and students at Marymount come together to explore real-world problems using technology and data. Whether you’re just getting started with a research idea or working on your doctoral dissertation, we’re here to support you.

Our goal is to build a supportive, creative space where research happens at all levels — from undergraduate class projects to advanced graduate work. We help connect students with mentors, tools, and other researchers so great ideas can grow.

This site highlights the work being done in the lab, including student projects, faculty collaborations, publications, and more. Take a look around, and if you're curious about getting involved, reach out!
